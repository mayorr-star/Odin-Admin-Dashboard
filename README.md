## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

In this project, I used css grid for the positioning of the elements across the page. This has increased my understanding of css grid. I have also learnt how to create  resopnsive layout using css grid. I look forward to learning more and improving my css skills. Below are some snippets:
```css
.projects_content{
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
    gap: 20px;
}

.project .action_block{
    margin-top: 30px;
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
    grid-row: 3;
    grid-column: 7 / 13;
}
```

### Continued development

There are some css grid properties I'm still not comfortable with(grid-area). I will focus on this area in my next project.
